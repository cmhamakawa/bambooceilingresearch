# A Mathematical Model of the Impact of Assertiveness on Advancement in Professional Hierarchies

This is the github for the paper titled "A Mathematical Model of the Impact of Assertiveness on Advancement in Professional Hierarchies". It contains both the data analysis and the mathematical model used for the paper.

1. **EOCC Data Analysis**: This contains the webscraping, data visualizations and data analysis of the EOCC data.
2. **Mathematical Model**: This directory contains both the programmed model and the visualized simulation results of the model.

Details to understand the reasoning behind the code can be found in the paper. To understand the code and files specifically, there is more detailed documentation in each directory.
